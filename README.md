# Reason_for_Resignation_Analysis

This project aims at cleaning and analyzing Employee Exit Survey responses from employees of Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE), and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia.

Specifically, I looked to gain answers to the following questions:

    Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
    Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

i had to combine the two datasets containing results for both surveys to answer the above questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers - something that introduced some complications into my work.
